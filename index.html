        Here, we'll define the core aesthetic of the site. Instead of just
        using default Tailwind colors, we define a custom, rich theme using 
        CSS Variables. This makes the design cohesive and easy to tweak.
        We also add custom classes for animations and typography that go beyond
        standard utilities.

                        <p>It was our first real fight...well not really? moreso a small disagreement. I hated knowing I made you feel like I didn’t care when really, I care so much it aches sometimes. And when we talked, I felt it - that tightness in your voice. The way you were trying to be calm, trying not to snap, but still hurting.</p>
                        <p>So I cried. Not because you yelled. You didn’t. I cried because you didn’t become someone else in your frustration. Because you stayed you.</p>

                        <p>A few nights later, we found ourselves side by side again... We were simply dreaming. You asked me what I pictured for our future, and the answers came so naturally it surprised me. A small apartment with warm light, wooden floors, your half-full mug, my paints, a dog, and a cat. Our home.</p>
                        <p>We were honest. We were both scared. But through that worry, we stayed with the vision. Because we know it’s not just the destination that matters, but who we’re walking with.</p>
                        <p class="font-semibold text-white">So this is what I wanted to keep. A reminder of how even in frustration, you showed me grace. And in fear, you gave me hope. Thank you for loving me the way you do.</p>

                    <p>It finally happened. The kind of missing that doesn’t just sit quietly... but claws at your chest until it spills out in tears. Summer class was supposed to be just three weeks. It ended up being some of the hardest, most exhausting days.</p>
                    <p>I was barely hanging on. My anxiety was through the roof. Home wasn’t even home anymore. I had no space to breathe. I missed you every day... but one night, it wasn’t just a message. I typed “I miss you” like I always did. Then I broke.</p>
                    <p>Tears started coming and they didn’t stop. I wanted you so badly in that moment, not just to talk to, but to hold me. To ground me. I didn’t want to be brave or okay or strong. I just wanted you.</p>

    When it "observes" a `.reveal` element, it adds the `.is-visible` class,
